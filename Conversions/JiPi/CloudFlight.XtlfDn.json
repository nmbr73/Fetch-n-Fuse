The scene is supposed \n\tto look a little artificial or cartoony, so I wouldn't take it too seriously. :)\n\n\tThere are plenty of realistic cloud shaders on Shadertoy, so I thought I'd do a stylized\n\tversion. Plus, I had to cheap out on everything, so realism wasn't exactly an option. :)\n\tThe colors and contrast have deliberately been exaggerated to give it more of a surreal \n\tfeel. The ramped up contrast also serves to allow the viewer to more easily discern the \n\tindividual cloud shapes. \n\n\tIn case anyone was wondering, the cloud shapes were emphasized by assigning a much higher \n\tweighting to the larger low frequency base layers. Giving the clouds a denser look was a \n\tstyle choice, but it's possible to make them fluffier and more traditional looking with \n\ta few tweaks here and there.\n\n\tOne of the things you figure out pretty quickly when doing this kind of thing is that when \n\tyou don't have enough iterations to work with, fake physics tend to work better than real\n\tphysics. For real shadows, you need to traverse toward the light several times. In this \n\texample, you're doing so just once, which is bordering on pathetic. :) Therefore, it's \n\tnecessary to darken the one-tap shadow value to give the impression that more shadowing \n\tis happening. However, you'll never produce a real shadow cast, no matter how hard you try.\n\n\tIt'd be nice to put up an example with volumetric shadowing, etc, but I don't think the\n\taverage GPU is quite fast enough yet. Having said that, I might see what I can come up\n\twith.\n\t\n\tBased on:\n\t\n\tCloudy Spikeball - Duke\n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/MljXDw\n    \/\/ Port from a demo by Las - Worth watching.\n    \/\/ http:\/\/www.pouet.net\/topic.php?which=7920&page=29&x=14&y=9\n\n\t\/\/ One of my favorite volumetric examples.
