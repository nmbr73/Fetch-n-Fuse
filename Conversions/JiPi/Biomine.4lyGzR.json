I wasn't really sure what I was creating when I started, and I'm still not. :) I at \n\tleast wanted to create the sense that the tubes were pumping some form of biomatter around \n\twithout having to resort to full reflective and refractive passes... I kind of got there. :)\n\n\tAll things considered, there's not a lot to this. Combine a couple of gyroid surfaces, ID them,\n\tthen add their respective material properties. The scene is simple to create, and explained in\n\tthe distance function. There's also some function based, 2nd order cellular bump mapping, for \n\tanyone interested.\n\n\tThe fluid pumped through the tubes was created by indexing the reflected and refracted rays \n\tinto a basic environment mapping function.
