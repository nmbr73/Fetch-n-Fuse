It's a great 2D effect. The fractal cube example is a simple \n    extension on that. The 3D version is less common, but for anyone curious\n    as to what that would look like, here it is. There are so many ways to \n    code one of these, and I've coded them all at one time or another, but \n    this is my preferred method.\n    \n    The first iteration comprises two lines of repeat cubes rotated about\n    the X-axis by a ceratin amount and then rotated about the Y axis by \n    another. Determining the correct rotations can be annoying, but\n    luckily for me, a younger version of myself got out a pen and paper and\n    figured them out years ago, so I only had to copy them. :)\n    \n    The top layers consist of single offset-row repeat grids containing\n    smaller cubes offset and rotated at the same fixed amounts as the first \n    layer... The code in the \"map\" function should make it clearer.\n    \n    Anyway, there's not a lot to this, but it might be interesting for \n    anyone who's ever wanted to make one of these.\n    \n    \n   \n    Other examples:\n\n\t\/\/ You can't have a cube example without referencing this.
