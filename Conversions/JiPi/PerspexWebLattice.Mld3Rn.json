My best guess is that an Alien race with no \n\tcommon sense designed a monitor system with physics defying materials. :)\n\n\tTechnically speaking, there's not much to it. It's just some raymarched 2nd order Voronoi.\n\tThe dark perspex-looking web lattice is created by manipulating the Voronoi value slightly \n\tand giving the effected region an ID value so as to color it differently, but that's about\n\tit. The details are contained in the \"heightMap\" function.\n\n\tThere's also some subtle edge detection in order to give the example a slight comic look. \n\t3D geometric edge detection doesn't really differ a great deal in concept from 2D pixel \n\tedge detection, but it obviously involves more processing power. However, it's possible to \n\tcombine the edge detection with the normal calculation and virtually get it for free. Kali \n\tuses it to great effect in his \"Fractal Land\" example. It's also possible to do a\n\ttetrahedral version... I think Nimitz and some others may have done it already. Anyway, \n\tyou can see how it's done in the \"nr\" (normal) function.\n\n\tGeometric edge related examples:\n\n\tFractal Land - Kali\n\thttps:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/XsBXWt\n\n\tRotating Cubes - Shau\n\thttps:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/4sGSRc\n\n\tVoronoi mesh related:\n\n    \/\/ I haven't really looked into this, but it's interesting.\n\tWeaved Voronoi - FabriceNeyret2 \n    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/ltsXRM\n\n*\/\n\n#define FAR 2.\n\nint id = 0; \/\/ Object ID - Red perspex: 0; Black lattice: 1.\n\n\n\/\/ Tri-Planar blending function.
