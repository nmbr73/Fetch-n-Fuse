:construction: ***ADD SOME REASONABLE DESCRIPTION HERE!*** Frozen wasteland. Built on nimitz's model, although I didn't use his fog stuff after all. It uses fog ray tracing included within the main ray march. Which means it tends to be thicker in the smaller ray incremental areas near objects. :construction:
